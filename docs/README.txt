This directory contains Midiki documentation. The user's manual
is provided in Word format and as HTML generated from the Word
document. The directory also contains four GIF files documenting
the Midiki core libraries in UML. The diagrams were generated
using ArgoUML 1.4. They are not entirely up to date, and reflect
the end of the design stage rather than the 1.0 release, but they
may help the more sophisticated user to understand the code.
