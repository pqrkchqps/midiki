Provides the distributed information state for dialogue management.
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Midiki is built on the concept of a distributed information state, built up
as a forest of typed feature structures. The feature structures and their
components are manipulated through logical unification. This package provides
an abstraction of the data and service distribution mechanism.
<h3>Information State distribution</h3>
The information state is constructed from individual <b>Cells</b>.
A cell is an implementation of a <code>Contract</code>, which is analogous
to a named type with zero or more attributes. Some of
these attributes may be methods, of two types:
<ul><li>Query - may not change the information state, but may return multiple
alternative variable bindings</li>
<li>Action - expected to change the information state, but may not return
more than one set of bindings</li></ul></li>
 Attributes reflect data
that is propagated to all clients of the information state, and which can be
monitored for changes. Methods and queries reflect services which are provided
by some client of the information state, and which can be invoked by any
other client.<p>
Every code>Contract</code> must be provided by some agent. The provider
maintains the <code>Cell</code> for that <code>Contract</code>, and executes 
any associated method calls.
A contract that is not provided has no real existence. The mechanisms for
specifying who provides which cells is outside the scope of this library.<p>
The information state passes through four stages of existence:<p>
<ul><li>Definition</li>
<li>Instantiation</li>
<li>Execution</li>
<li>Termination</li></ul>
<h4>Definition</h4>
Defining the information state requires the definition of each of the component
cells. Since each cell is defined by a contract, this step becomes
the specification of all of the contracts your application
requires, and the construction of a <code>Cell</code> for each
<code>Contract</code> this agent will provide.<p>

<h4>Instantiation</h4>
An information state is built from the following components:<p>
<ul><li>Descriptions of the contracts required from external sources</li>
<li>Descriptions of the cells provided locally</li>
<li>The desired agent communication method (if none is specified, a default
method will be used)</li>
<li>A source of system configuration information</li>
</ul><p>
Pass those arguments to the instance of <code>InfoStateFactory</code>,
which will return an <code>InfoState</code> object initialized with
the specified structure.<p>
It is possible to call the factory multiple times with different agent
protocols and different root sets. 
If an identical root cell is specified for two different agent protocols,
a <code>Bridge</code> will automatically be constructed to maintain a
consistent view of that cell across both protocols. This bridge transparently
passes data and method calls in both directions, but doesn't perform any form
of semantic translation.<p>
Calls for protocols which aren't supported by the system as configured
will return <code>null</code>.<p>

<h4>Execution</h4>
Once the information state has been initialized, <code>InfoListeners</code>
can be registered. These listeners will be notified whenever the associated
attribute is changed. It is the responsibility of the listener to evaluate
the new value and any additional information to ensure that it is activating
properly.<p>

<h4>Termination</h4>
Currently there are no termination methods defined for the information state.
The information state terminates after it goes out of scope. There may be a
need for finer control over the lifecycle of the information state.<p>
